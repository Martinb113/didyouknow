Welcome to another ASK AT&T Quick Start.

0:03
So the goal of every one of these videos is to learn something useful in 5 minutes or less.

0:08
The last video we learned how to find and shape information.

0:11
In this one, we're going to be learning about how to make a presentation draft really easily.

0:16
So let's just go ahead and dive right in.

0:19
Here's the scenario you need to do an E Sports presentation.

0:23
And so let's just start with the basics.

0:26
Make a presentation on E Sports.

0:32
As we know, Ask AT&T will do everything it can to respond to a prompt.

0:38
By the way, This is why sometimes Ask AT&T can make mistakes.

0:43
It can give different information or inaccurate information because it's trying to respond to every single prompt.

0:49
So always make sure you check it.

0:51
But regardless, this one's pretty straightforward.

0:54
Make a presentation on E Sports and here we go.

0:57
So we've got slides, we've got bullet points, pretty helpful in terms of a presentation, but this isn't quite what I needed.

1:07
And the goal of every prompt is to get us as close as possible to what we need in one prompt.

1:14
So what we're going to do is we're going to add a lot more context in the scenario here is that, you know your kids school or something asked you to help out.

1:22
And so we've got a very specific audience here of junior high students and and really it's about helping them create a a really robust winning wired network for E sports.

1:33
So we want to Add all of that context.

1:37
So let's start again.

1:38
You are giving a presentation to junior high students, right?

1:46
We're giving some audience, we're giving some context on the basics of a wired network for esports, so that'll get us a lot closer.

1:56
But let's be more specific, Make a brief 10 minute presentation that will be on PowerPoint slides.

2:08
So again, we're giving a lot more context so that asks AT&T knows how to respond.

2:13
For each slide, make a title and bullet points.

2:19
At the end of the slides information, write a script For the entire presentation, include at least one dad joke about E Sports.

2:39
We'll see what Ask AT&T comes up with now just know with these longer prompts or where we're really asking it to generate a lot more information, it can take a little while.

2:50
So don't be surprised if it takes a little while for it to respond.

2:58
And here we go.

2:59
So when we look here, we've got our slides, we've got the bullet points and we have our script.

3:09
So we've got everything right here, and Dad joke of the day didn't quite interpret what we wanted so we could refine that prompt a little bit more.

3:18
But right here, why did the E Sports player go broke?

3:22
Because he couldn't find any LAN parties to attend.

3:25
Not sure if that's as good of a joke as I would have wanted, but you can see it tried.

3:30
So we've got all of the components here.

3:33
Not great, but it's pretty good for how quickly we pulled this together.

3:37
But let's try one more trick and see if this works.

3:40
So I'm going to go ahead and copy this information that we've got here in the slides and I'm going to go to a blank Word Online document.

3:52
I'm going to go ahead and paste it in.

3:53
So here is our presentation.

3:56
I'm going to go to file export, Export to PowerPoint presentation.

4:02
Now you'll note this says preview.

4:04
That's because this is an experimental feature, so sometimes it doesn't work.

4:08
You can see behind the scenes it has interpreted what we've been trying to do.

4:12
So introduction of wire networks for E sports, I'll go ahead and select that.

4:16
I'll hit export.

4:18
We get this great little graphic and our presentation is ready.

4:21
So now I'm going to click open presentation and here it is.

4:26
Here is our first draft PowerPoint presentation from the stuff that we just didn't ask AT&T.

4:33
And you can even say, see, it has added some graphics trying to interpret what we've been talking about.

4:39
Here's all of our bullet points.

4:41
And again, here we've got the same graphic, but of course there's other options.

4:45
And then we've got some of our, you know, got our joke icon.

4:50
So again, you can see where this is going, where we'll be able to make incredible presentations very quickly.

4:59
And of course those will be on brand unlike this and other things.

5:02
But that's the direction that generative AI is going.

5:05
So get used to it now and get started.

5:08
So let's go ahead and go back to ask AT&T and just think about this a minute.

5:13
How quickly can you generate a presentation on different topics for different audiences, for different durations?

5:21
With all of that detail and all of that context in your prompt, you can get very close very quickly to where you needed to go.

5:31
If you find a prompt that works really well for you, make sure you share it down below, or you can submit it for our prompt Hall of Fame until the next video.

5:42
Happy prompting and keep at it.
