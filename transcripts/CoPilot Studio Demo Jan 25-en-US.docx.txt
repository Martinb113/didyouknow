CoPilot Studio Demo Jan 25

0:00
Here's a real quick demo of Copilot Studio.

0:03
Copilot Studio is one of the tools that we're really excited about for business that should be coming in the next couple quarters.

0:11
So basically it lets you create a bunch of easy AI tools based on simple templates.

0:18
So if you think of all of the power platforms of power, Automate, prompt flow, things like that, Copilot Studio is a part of that.

0:26
So I'm just going to do a quick little demo.

0:28
This is the AI Insights page.

0:30
It's probably where you're watching this video.

0:32
It has a bunch of information about prompting an AI, but instead of clicking around, what if we could just add a chat bot?

0:41
So that's what I'm going to do.

0:42
I'm going to pick this template website QA, and it loads with some simple stuff.

0:47
I'm just going to call it my demo copilot.

0:51
We could update the descriptions, we could update the instructions, but just doing a fast demo here.

0:56
And then for knowledge, I'm going to add knowledge.

0:59
The knowledge I'm going to use is a SharePoint.

1:02
I'm going to put in the AI Insights URL.

1:06
There it is.

1:07
I hit add.

1:08
I hit add.

1:09
I'm going to remove the outside knowledge and I'm going to hit create and it is that simple to get the first version out the door.

1:20
Now there's a few more steps, but for the most part that's it.

1:27
We can tune this more.

1:28
This is obviously a really quick demo to get to a first draft.

1:31
One thing I'm going to turn off this enabled so it will not use any internal knowledge.

1:37
It'll only use the knowledge from the SharePoint, not from the model.

1:42
And that is it.

1:44
By the way, no editing, no nothing on this.

1:46
So this is in real time.

1:48
What are some ways I can get better at prompting?

1:54
So again, instead of clicking around the website, I can do some stuff with an actual chat bot.

2:00
I could obviously make all sorts of other triggers.

2:02
I could do all sorts of other things, and this is an incredibly powerful tool.

2:07
But here it is.

2:09
Here is an answer and it gives a reference and that takes us back to the page where it found the information.

2:18
So there you go, a really quick demo of Copilot Studio, one of the tools that we are really excited about.

2:24
It's a easy way to build agents and chat bots and really just tackle a lot of the use cases that we all need for productivity.

2:35
And also just a a great way to to get some stuff done so that we can use AI in our everyday workflows.
