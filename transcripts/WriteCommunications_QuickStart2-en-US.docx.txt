Welcome to another Ask AT&T Quick Start.

0:04
So in this video, in 5 minutes or less, we're going to be looking at how you can generate communications and also how you can refine communications.

0:13
So as always, let's go ahead and start with a prompt.

0:18
You are a friendly expert in cybersecurity.

0:27
Write A blog post that's 300 to 400 words long, appropriate for a general audience, that explains why they shouldn't reuse passwords.

0:46
Now I'm going to go ahead and submit that.

0:48
And again, we're following basic prompt stuff, right?

0:52
We're giving directions, We're giving context.

0:57
We're giving an audience, and we're trying to give enough information so that Ask AT&T can generate quickly what it is we're looking for.

1:06
Now, there's some nuance in Word choice that can make a big difference, so let's go ahead and see what we got here.

1:13
So again, you're a friendly expert.

1:15
Dangers of reusing passwords, right?

1:18
Hello, dear readers, the cybersecurity enthusiast, Right.

1:22
We've got all of the stuff in here.

1:23
It's friendly.

1:24
It's it's it's pretty straightforward.

1:28
But again this is drafting communications.

1:30
Let's say that we have a different audience right.

1:32
We have a different audience in the way that we're doing this.

1:34
So I'm going to go ahead and use the exact same prompt, but I'm going to change a few words so that we can see how Ask AT&T response.

1:47
So you're you are a, you're an expert in cyber security.

1:53
That's appropriate for a highly technical, sophisticated audience.

2:08
That explains why they shouldn't reuse passwords.

2:12
So again just changing a few words gives it a very different tone, a very different output that we're looking for and we'll see what Ask ATT produces.

2:26
OK.

2:26
So here we go.

2:28
We've got very different terms, right, cyber hygiene right here off the bat.

2:33
We've got multi factor authentication, password complexity.

2:37
So again, the content is very similar, but in this particular example, you can see how changing those words a little bit generated a slightly different first draft.

2:52
And so it's really important to make sure that you think about your word choice as you write these prompts.

3:00
Now just to be clear, you don't have to always use Ask AT&T to generate new content.

3:06
You can use it to refine existing content.

3:09
And I'm going to show you an example right now.

3:13
So I'm going to paste in a prompt here because it's a little long and we'll go ahead and take a look at it.

3:19
You're a friendly expert in cybersecurity?

3:20
Rewrite the following draft ideas into a series of five posts for social media.

3:26
Suggest an image for each post.

3:28
This is a little bit more complicated.

3:31
First of all, this text here was generated by Ask AT and TI asked it to generate some sample text that I could use as an example.

3:40
And what we're asking for is 5 posts for social media.

3:43
But I'm not giving much information, right?

3:45
I'm not saying any specific social media.

3:47
I'm.

3:48
I'm not giving it, you know, Twitter, where we might have a different limit of characters, right, Versus, you know, Instagram, which is much more visual.

3:58
I gave, still a fairly vague, but let's see what we get.

4:01
What we're really trying to show here is that Ask AT&T can help you rewrite things.

4:08
It can help you take a bunch of information and summarize it.

4:12
It can help you change it for different audiences.

4:15
Oh, and here we go.

4:16
So we've got post one and you can see post 2.

4:20
Post 3.

4:20
We've got these great little emojis that it's added because it's social media.

4:25
And then we've got image suggestions.

4:27
So here Ask AT&T has taken all these pieces of information that we included in the prompt.

4:36
Remember, prompts can be very long and it has rewritten it into a different use.

4:44
So just to show a different example, I'm going to use almost the exact same information.

4:51
We've got all of our password stuff here, only the prompt is going to be a little different.

4:55
Rewrite the following draft ideas into a concise memo suitable for an executive.

5:01
So again, the idea here is that Ask AT&T can help us generate information, but it can also help us rewrite and shape and change information that we give it into a different form.

5:19
OK, so here we go.

5:21
We now have our memo that has been written obviously in a very different tone, very different form than we got in our social media posts that had all these great little emojis, right?

5:35
So you can see Ask AT&T is really good at helping you draft original and rewrite communications for whatever purpose you want it to be, whether that's fun social media or direct executive memos and really everything in between.

5:52
If you find a prompt that works really well for you, don't keep it to yourself.

5:57
Share it.

5:58
You can share it down below, or you can fill out one of our forms for our prompt Hall of Fame and make sure that we share this prompt with everyone until the next video keep prompting.
