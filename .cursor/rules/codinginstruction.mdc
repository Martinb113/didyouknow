# Email Template Development Guidelines

## Structure and Compatibility
- Use HTML tables for layout (Outlook Desktop requirement)
- Inline CSS only - no external stylesheets
- Max width: 600px for optimal email client display
- Images must include alt text and width/height attributes

## CSS Restrictions
- Avoid CSS properties not supported by Outlook Desktop:
  - background-image
  - position: absolute/relative
  - flexbox/grid
  - margin (use padding instead)
- Use HTML attributes for spacing and alignment

## Image Guidelines
- Host images on reliable CDN/server
- Optimize images for email (max width 600px)
- Mark clickable images in email_script.md with [CLICKABLE] tag
- Include fallback text for all images

## Template Structure
- email1.html serves as the base template
- Maintain consistent CSS formatting across all email variations
- Each new email inherits styling from base template
- Document image sources and click-through URLs in comments

## Best Practices
- Test across email clients, especially Outlook Desktop
- Keep file size under 100KB when possible
- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Implement mobile-responsive design using media queries

@email1.html - Base template reference
@email_script.md - Content and image specifications
