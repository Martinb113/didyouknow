# Email Template Development Guidelines

## Structure and Compatibility
- Use a responsive layout approach with modern CSS
- Inline CSS for email client compatibility
- Max width: 640px for optimal email client display
- Images must include alt text and width/height attributes

## CSS Recommendations
- Leverage modern CSS where supported:
  - Flexbox for layout
  - CSS Grid for complex layouts
  - Media queries for responsiveness
  - Custom fonts with appropriate fallbacks
- Maintain fallback styling for older clients

## Image Guidelines
- Host images on reliable CDN/server
- Optimize images for email (max width 640px)
- Mark clickable images in email_script.md with [CLICKABLE] tag
- Include fallback text for all images
- Use modern formats (WebP) with fallbacks

## Template Structure
- email1b.html serves as the base template
- Maintain consistent CSS formatting across all email variations
- Each new email inherits styling from base template
- Document image sources and click-through URLs in comments

## Best Practices
- Keep file size under 100KB when possible
- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Implement mobile-responsive design using media queries
- Use semantic HTML elements where supported
- Light mode compatibility
