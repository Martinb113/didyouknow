Welcome to another Ask AT&T Quick Start where we try to do something awesome in 5 minutes or less with Ask AT&T.

0:09
This video we're going to be looking at how you can interact with some data.

0:13
Now just to be clear, Ask AT&T is not the best tool for interacting with large data sets.

0:20
There are better tools, however, Ask AT&T as a large language model is pretty good with dealing with words.

0:28
So we're going to show a few tricks today and how you can use Ask AT&T to help you out.

0:34
So this is a common problem.

0:37
You're doing some research and you come across a PDF that has some information you want, but since it's in a PDF, you can't really manipulate or work with the data.

0:46
If you try to paste this into Excel, you just get a mess.

0:51
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select the data.

0:54
I'm going to go ahead and just copy it.

0:57
I'm going to go to Ask AT&T and I'm going to say convert the following information into a CSV, right, a comma separated values arrangement so that I can easily just paste it into Excel.

1:16
Now just to be clear, you can see we've got commas in the numbers, so we can go ahead and check and see how Ask AT&T does converting this text into CSV and there it is.

1:34
So this trick doesn't always work, but just know it's a pretty good way to take information and PDFs or other text based formats and convert them into something that you can manipulate with it with Excel and run analysis on.

1:51
So there's one great example.

1:56
So another way that you can use Ask AT&T with text is doing basically sentiment analysis.

2:04
So I've generated a fake list about puppies using Ask AT&T by the way, and I'm going to go ahead and ask some questions.

2:13
So how many comments from the following list are positive?

2:21
Now obviously, I could go through and count this, but let's just go ahead and have Ask AT&T do this for us.

2:38
And so here's the comments.

2:39
Remember, they're fake.

2:40
I just had to ask AT&T generate them so that we would have some content that we could ask a question about.

2:48
And so we've got our result.

2:51
So here it is in the list provided.

2:52
There are 12 comments that can be considered positive.

2:56
So again it has gone through, it's analyzed it and it is giving us based on this text, a number and it goes ahead and gives us a summary.

3:04
Of course, if we want more detailed information, we can make a better prompt with more context and with more detail so that we get additional information.

3:13
Just to show another way that we could use this, what is the most negative comment from the following list?

3:24
Now again, we're not defining negativity, we're not defining most.

3:30
We're not providing additional parameters that would give us better results.

3:34
But we're just going to go ahead and use Ask AT&T out-of-the-box to help us sort some text.

3:41
And here it is.

3:42
I don't understand the hype about puppies.

3:45
So it went ahead and picked the most negative comment from that list.

3:51
So there you have it, Two quick and easy ways you can use ASK AT&T to help you with text based data.

3:59
So think about that.

4:00
What are the challenges that you have around data?

4:04
Around analyzing text, around sorting text, around converting text based information that you can write prompts for and use?

4:15
